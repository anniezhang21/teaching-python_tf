Phase 1:

Create a program that will ask the user to input a desired height for their triangle,
and then draw a triangle with the specified height, as shown below.


>>> Height: 5
*
**
***
****
*****

>>> Height: 3
*
**
***



Phase 2:

Same as phase 1, but instead print an isosceles triangle. (Note, to print multiple times on the same line,
use the additional argument     end=''  so that your print statement looks like print('something', end='')


>>> Height: 5
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********

>>> Height: 3
  *
 ***
*****


Phase 3:

Same as phase 2, only instead of stars, print Pascal's Triangle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)
up to the specified height. This is a fairly difficult problem.


>>> Height: 5
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1

>>> Height: 3
  1
 1 1
1 2 1
